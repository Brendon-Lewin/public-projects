# Pastoral Dashboard
The goal of this project was to create a dashboard in Power BI for use by the year heads to quickly analyse key pastoral indicators, such as mertis, demerits, attendance, and lates. The aim was to allow as much flexibility as possible so the users could get the data they need quickly without introducing too much complexity. This was achieved by having multiple reports run inside SIMS each night and automatically export the data to csv files which would be synced to a SharePoint folder automatically. Power BI would then pick up these csv files and allow staff to visualise the data contained in them.
Please note, some of the data in the screenshots below has been redacted for data protection purposes.

## Year group overview

The first dashboard is meant for use by the school's year heads to quickly get an overview of the pastoral data for their year group over the last week, fortnight, month, or term. They simpley select their year group from the list and the dashboard displays the merit, demerit, attendance, and late data aggregated by registration group. When hovering over one of the bars a custom tooltip is shown displaying the data aggregated by student for that form group. This allows the year head to get a quick overview of how things are going for each form group and quickly identify student issues in a visual and intuative way.

## Top 10

Similar to the year group overview, this dashboard was created for use by the year heads to quickly identify the top 10 students for praise or intervention based on the same data. For example, a year head may want to congratulate the top merit earners last week, or have a conversation with the top demerit earners. Hovering over any of the bars will show the other pastoral data for that student so links between them can be identified. For example, a student with poor attendance may also have a high percentage of lates.

The final dashboard is meant for form tutors and other staff to get a much more detailed view of a student's data over time. This was designed to be a useful resource to have infront of staff when they are writing reports, or during parental meetings to quickly gain useful insights into how a student is getting on and any changes in behaviour. For example, a for tutor may be able to see a recent dip in attendance and be able to intervene with the student to put it right early before it gets out of control. When hovering over any part of the graphs a custom tooltip is shown displaying the specific records for that day, so staff can investigate the causes of any large changes in the data and see the reasons for them.

## Outcome
Though this dashboard is still in the very early stages of development and testing it has already garnered a large amount of interest and excitment for not only easier and simpler access to student pastoral data, but the huge time saving that also represents.
